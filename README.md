#### Overview

This program runs a command line interface which allows users to preform a variety of GUI oriented tasks in a more object oriented manner.  The primary functionality is preformed by defining repeatable sequences of keyboard and mouse commmands.  These can then be incorporated into other repeatable sequences providing a powerfull way to perform highly redundant tasks without human interaction.

### QUICK START

The best way to get starte:

1. Install the dependancies that are required (below).
2. Open IDLE3
3. Run menu.py
4. interact with the command line interface.
5. for help use the help command from the main menu
6. To get familiar with the repeatable commands I suggest using excel and practicing setting up repeatable processes on cells.
